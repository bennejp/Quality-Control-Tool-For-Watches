## 💡 Best Practices

### From Experienced RepTime Users

**Keep It Simple:**
- The Hour Grid overlay is sufficient for most QC needs
- It includes center alignment (crosshair functionality)
- Avoid cluttering your QC image with unnecessary guides
- One clean, well-positioned overlay is better than multiple overlays

**Getting the Best Results:**
- **Start with image rotation** - Use 0.1° precision to perfectly straighten the watch
- **Use top-down photos** - Angled photos can make overlay alignment inaccurate
- **Center the Hour Grid** - Drag it to match the watch's center point
- **Size matters** - Adjust the overlay to match your watch's diameter
- **Less is more** - Only enable the overlay when you need it for specific checks

**What to Check:**
1. **Index Alignment** - Do all 12 hour markers align with the radial lines?
2. **Bezel Pip** - Is the triangle at 12 o'clock centered?
3. **Hand Alignment** - Do the hands meet at the true center?
4. **Overall Symmetry** - Does everything look balanced?

**Pro Tips:**
- You can adjust overlay opacity if it's too bold
- Keyboard arrows work for fine overlay positioning (Hold Shift for faster movement)
- Export your annotated image to share with the community

## 🔍 Watch QC Checklist

Use the Hour Grid overlay to check for these common quality issues:

### 🎯 Critical Checks (Use Hour Grid)
- ✅ **Index Alignment** - Verify all 12 hour markers align with the radial lines
- ✅ **Bezel Alignment** - Check bezel pip is centered at 12 o'clock position
- ✅ **Hand Alignment** - Ensure hour and minute hands meet at exact center point
- ✅ **Center Positioning** - Verify watch dial is properly centered

### 👀 Visual Inspection (No Overlay Needed)
- ✅ **Date Wheel Centering** - Check date sits centered in window
- ✅ **Dial Printing** - Look for misprints, smudges, crooked text, or alignment issues
- ✅ **SEL Gaps** - Inspect Solid End Link gaps between bracelet and case
- ✅ **Timegrapher Numbers** - Review movement performance measurements

### 🔬 Common Defects to Look For
- ❌ Misaligned hour markers (especially 12, 3, 6, 9 o'clock)
- ❌ Crooked date wheel or off-center date
- ❌ Uneven bezel insert or misaligned pip
- ❌ Dial dust, fingerprints, or debris under crystal
- ❌ Hand stack rubbing or misalignment
- ❌ Rehaut misalignment (internal bezel engraving)
- ❌ Crystal scratches or AR coating defects
- ❌ Poor dial printing quality or crooked text

## 🌟 What's New

## 🎨 Customization

### Changing Overlay Color

Use the color picker in the Controls panel to change the Hour Grid color to match your preference or to contrast with your watch dial.

### Changing UI Colors

Edit CSS variables in `src/styles/index.css`:
```css
:root {
  --accent-primary: #ec4899;  /* Pink */
  --accent-secondary: #8b5cf6; /* Purple */
}
```

### Adding New Overlays (Advanced)

1. Create a new overlay component in `src/overlays/`
2. Import and add to the Canvas component's render logic in `Canvas.tsx`
3. Add overlay configuration to `initialOverlays` in `App.tsx`

**Note**: Based on feedback from experienced RepTime users, we recommend keeping overlays minimal. The Hour Grid is designed to cover all essential QC needs.
